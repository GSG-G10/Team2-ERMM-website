                departed Bagram Airbase.</figcaption>
            <p class="main-news p1 paragraph ">The US military left Bagram Airfield - its key base in Afghanistan - in
                the dead of
                night without notifying the Afghans, the base's new commander said. </p>
            <p class="main-news paragraph">General Asadullah Kohistani told the BBC that the US left Bagram at 03:00
                local time on
                Friday, and that the Afghan military found out hours later.</p>
            <p class="main-news paragraph">Bagram also contains a prison, and there are reportedly up to 5,000 Taliban
                prisoners
                left in the facility. </p>
            <p class="main-news paragraph">The Taliban have been advancing rapidly in Afghanistan as US troops withdraw.
            </p>
            <p class="main-news paragraph">General Kohistani said on Monday that Afghan forces were expecting the
                Taliban to
                attack Bagram.</p>
            <p class="main-news paragraph">Speaking to reporters at the airbase, he said he was already receiving
                reports the
                group was making "movements in rural areas" nearby. </p>
            <p class="main-news paragraph">"You know, if we compare ourselves with the Americans, it's a big
                difference," Gen
                Kohistani said. "But according to our capabilities... we are trying to do the best and as much as
                possible secure and serve all the people."</p>

            <figcaption class="imgFigcaption"> An Afghan army soldier keeps watch at Bagram, the morning after US troops
                withdrew during the night</figcaption>
            <p class="main-news paragraph">The US announced on Friday that it had vacated Bagram, effectively completing
                its
                military campaign in Afghanistan ahead of the official end date of 11 September, announced by President
                Joe Biden earlier this year.</p>
            <p class="main-news paragraph">The withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan is more than 90% completed, the
                Pentagon's
                Central Command said on Tuesday.</p>
            <p class="main-news paragraph">The Americans left behind about 3.5 million items, Gen Kohistani said,
                including tens
                of thousands of bottles of water, energy drinks and military ready-made meals, known as MREs. They also
                left behind thousands of civilian vehicles, without keys, and hundreds of armoured vehicles, the
                Associated Press reported. </p>
            <p class="main-news paragraph">They took heavy weapons with them and detonated some ammunition stocks, but
                left behind
                small weapons and ammunition for the Afghans, Gen Kohistani said. </p>
            <p class="main-news paragraph">Asked by the Associated Press about the late-night withdrawal from the base,
                US
                military spokesman Colonel Sonny Leggett referred to a statement issued last week that said US forces
                had co-ordinated their departure from various bases with Afghan leaders. </p>

                of armoured vehicles </figcaption>
            <p class="main-news paragraph">Within 20 minutes of the US's departure on Friday night the electricity was
                shut down
                and the base was plunged into darkness, the AP reported - a signal to looters who smashed through
                barriers and ransacked the abandoned buildings. Leftover items from the base have ended up in nearby
                scrap yards and second hand shops.</p>
            <p class="main-news paragraph">At its height, Bagram base was home to tens of thousands of troops. It
                ballooned from a
                basic Afghan air base to a mini-city with swimming pools, cinemas, spas and imported fast food outlets
                Burger King and Pizza Hut.</p>
            <p class="main-news paragraph">The airfield was built by the Soviet Union in the 1950s, becoming its main
                base in the
                1980s as it defended its occupation of Afghanistan. </p>
            <p class="main-news paragraph">It was later occupied by the Moscow-backed Afghan government and then a
                mujahideen
                administration, before eventually winding up in Taliban hands when the group swept to power in the mid
                1990s.</p>
            <p class="main-news paragraph">When the US invaded in 2001, it deposed the Taliban and took control of the
                airbase,
                transforming it into a sprawling complex from which it fought its war against the group.
